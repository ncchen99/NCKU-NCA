# NCKU-CA

NCKU-CA is an open-source CMS platform built on Firebase and Next.js.
It includes both frontend and backend systems, and this repository is currently used by the NCKU Club Association (NCKU-CA).

If you need Chinese documentation (中文的文件), please read: [README.zh-TW.md](README.zh-TW.md)

## Core Features

- Basic website content editing
- Article publishing (news and activity posts)
- Custom form builder and form submission
- Attendance tracking and deposit management

## Interface Demo

> Although the UI supports multilingual switching, current article content is primarily written in Chinese, so Chinese text may still appear in content sections.

## Why This Stack

- Deploy on Vercel and use Firebase as the backend.
- Use Cloudflare R2 as the image hosting service.
- Users can customize this CMS system based on their own organizational and workflow needs.
- With ISR and SSG, backend load is relatively low, helping increase practical traffic capacity as much as possible within Vercel free-tier limits.

Under baseline usage, this combination can run at zero cost on free tiers.
For self-hosted CMS scenarios, it is a practical low-cost architecture before traffic grows large.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend/Backend: Next.js (App Router)
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication + session flow
- Storage: Firebase Storage and optional Cloudflare R2 for images

## Project Structure

- `web/`: Main web application (public site, admin pages, APIs)
- `scripts/`: Data sync and seed scripts
- `data/`: Static and source content files

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd web
npm install
```

2. Create environment file

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

3. Fill required Firebase variables in `web/.env`

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64`

4. Run development server

```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

5. (Optional) Seed initial data

```bash
cd web
npm run seed
```

## I18n (Optional)

This project supports optional multilingual UI switching (Traditional Chinese and English).
To enable language switcher in the UI:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_I18N=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE=zh-TW
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE` controls the default locale (`zh-TW` or `en`).
If disabled (default), the language switcher is hidden and the site uses Traditional Chinese.

## Deployment and Configuration

You can deploy this project to any platform that supports Next.js + Node.js and can access Firebase services.

Recommended deployment checklist:

1. Prepare production Firebase project (Firestore + Auth + service account)
2. Set all required environment variables in your deployment platform
3. Build and start

```bash
cd web
npm run build
npm run start
```

4. Apply Firestore and Storage rules from `firebase/`
5. Verify admin login, content editing, form submission, attendance, and deposit workflows

This English README focuses on how to use this open-source system and how to deploy/configure it yourself.
